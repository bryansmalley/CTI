    "executive_summary": "Beginning in late 1974, Misanthropic Magpie has been quietly conducting mostly unsuccessful attempts to extort value from turnips in a process known as \"juicing\". These failures have been attributed to the dense nature of the structures housing the aforementioned turnip \"juice.\" \n\nDespite these setbacks, Misanthropic Magpie has shown that it's is nothing if not patient and dedicated. Recently, the actor has added the \"Juice Tiger\" toolset to its campaigns. This new tool has not resulted in any significant breaches of \"juice\", but it is believed that as Misanthropic Magpie is developing a companion add-on tool for \"Juice Tiger\" and which may warrant a reassessment of the threat posed. ",
